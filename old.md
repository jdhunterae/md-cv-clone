## Projects

### blog

I write a tech blog at [jdhunterae.github.io](http://jdhunterae.github.io) where I apply my own learning and research to questions I've answered and wished had been answered elsewhere. <!-- My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. -->

<!-- ### EdinbR -->

<!-- I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I help to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR). -->

<!-- ### datarea -->

<!-- I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/education/summer-data-challenge/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account. -->
